							Different fishermen will receive different benefits from a guided
							trip. Professional Fishermen on the tournament circuits hire
							guides when they fish new water. TV fishing shows hire guides as
							they travel to different sites, sometimes several different guides
							at the same time. So, the right question is not “Who needs a
							guide?”, but “What can I gain by hiring a Smallmouth Guide?”
							Guides are a different breed of people that sometimes cannot seem
							to place any importance on anything not directly related to
							fishing. Guides eat sleep and drink fishing. They live a life that
							only the most passionate fishermen can tolerate or relate to.
							Living on shoestring budgets, grabbing power naps in their trucks
							between morning and afternoon trips, catching shad in the hours
							and days when they are not guiding, But, they are a happy bunch,
							they love the life they have chosen, most cannot imagine ever
							doing or wanting to do anything else.

							These folks fish to live and live to fish and want to share their
							experiences with their clients, friends and family. Many guides I
							know spend 125+ days per year on the water. The real pleasure of
							guiding comes in watching a child, grown man or woman giggle like
							a school kid because they just caught a big Smallmouth bass in
							your favorite spot. No money can replace watching that type of
							exhilaration from children or grownups. Fishing reports or reading
							literature about lakes for the most part, cannot give you all the
							information you need to fish effectively in a few hours on a new
							lake. I read reports before I embark on new water, but only as a
							resource, fishing reports are yesterday’s news. They will never
							replace the knowledge you can receive from a guide who has been on
							particular lake fishing for Smallmouth bass 100 days a year, for
							years. The fishing reports might tell you Smallmouth are hitting
							tubes or some other nondescript baits off points, but the reports
							can in no way tell you what to do when you find the point and
							there seem to be no Smallmouth around. A Guide can. Because they
							have learned through trial and error and frustrating fishing days,
							what catches fish when what “always works”- isn’t working. It is
							this knowledge gained only by raw and sometime frustrating
							experience and years of persistence that can turn a slow day on
							the water into a day that creates lasting memories.

						Some fishermen revel in the challenge of “figuring out” new water,
						but if you are willing to spend thousands of dollars on equipment,
						rental cars, and accommodations, why not spend an extra couple
						bucks, hire a guide early in your trip, and learn some valuable
						inside information that will save you time and make your entire trip
						more productive. You may only get a few weekends a year to fish, so
						hire a guide your first day. Pick the guide’s brain on where to
						fish, what to use, and what time of day to be on the water and for
						the rest of your vacation. I am certain you will enjoy the trip much
						more. Pamper yourself. Let someone else furnish boat, tackle and
						bait. Tie your knots, undo your backlashes, take you to the best
						spots on the lake, tell you jokes and take your photos. If you have
						a map of Door County, take it out and look at it. There are
						approximately 300 miles of shoreline that hold Smallmouth bass. All
						Lakes and rivers are not created equally, and not all are suited to
						your particular style or your skill level. Especially in the July
						and August days when Smallmouth move deep or scatter throughout the
						lake.

						All Fisherman can learn from a guide. Beginners will be able to
						grasp the fundamentals more quickly in one day on the water with a
						guide, than they could in one month or much more fishing on their
						own. Most guides are patient, experienced objective teachers. They
						truly enjoy teaching a beginner how to catch their first fish or
						improve their skills. People tell me they listen better to
						instruction from a guide than their husband, brother, friend, or
						whoever got them started. Experienced anglers will learn better from
						a guide if they are honest with themselves and the guide about their
						strengths and weaknesses. Do not exaggerate your abilities to
						impress them. Everyone serious about catching or learning to catch a
						large Smallmouth can benefit from a day with Captain Chris Johnson
						of Fishcrazy Guide Service. Communication is the key to a successful
						fishing trip. Let your guide know what you expect, what you like and
						don’t like. Ask what type of technique you will be using, what type
						of baits you will be fishing with.

						Not all guides are alike; some will bark at you like a drill
						sergeant all day long, some are very mellow and relaxed. The one
						thing guides all have in common is the love of Fishing. Find one
						that suits your style and you will become lifelong friends. The
						trips I enjoy the most are the ones with my return clients, we know
						each other, and we have developed an understanding of each other. I
						cherish these relationships. If you do your homework, you will find
						a guide you enjoy, that I can promise you. Each guide has their own
						unique style. I learn something new every time I am on the water,
						not to mention the pleasure getting to enjoy what I love to do with
						people who love to do it. These are just a few reasons to hire a
						guide and there are many more reasons, but you hire them for their
						knowledge and their ability to find and produce fish. They know the
						water and know the different area’s where the fish are. A good guide
						has this knowledge and ability. A great guide will show you more in
						a day then most learn in a month. They also will make it fun for you
						and your partner.

						What a Guide Expects from You: Truthfulness: Don’t try to tell the
						guide that you know what you are doing he will soon catch on. Give
						him an assessment of your skills and abilities up front. That lets
						the guides tailor his trip to your abilities, making it a great trip
						for you. If you are physically challenged or have a handicap this
						should be told to the person who is booking the trip so it can be
						handled before you head out. Courtesy: The guide you hire should be
						a professional and should be treated with respect. You can help with
						a bag or rod if he looks like he needs help. He will help you with
						your equipment if you need it. If you’re fishing with a partner
						don’t help your partner out let the guide do that. Its great to
						offer encouragement, but don’t interrupt while the guide is
						attempting to instruct. Expectations: You are paying a bit for a
						guided trip and you expect to catch fish. Hiring a guide is like
						going to the doctor or getting your car fixed. You need to check his
						references, referrals or testimonials from the guys who have
						experienced these trips. There are no guarantees you will catch fish
						every time you go out.
